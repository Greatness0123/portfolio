## Post Text

🚀 Excited to share my latest project: **Control** - The AI-powered desktop assistant that's changing how we interact with computers!

🎯 **What makes Control special?**
✨ Natural language commands to control your entire computer
🖥️ Browser automation with simple voice instructions
🤖 AI-powered understanding of complex tasks
⚡ Seamless integration with your workflow

Instead of clicking through menus and remembering shortcuts, just tell Control what you want to do:
• "Open my project folder and start the development server"
• "Take a screenshot and save it to my desktop"
• "Close all browser tabs except the current one"

The future of human-computer interaction is here, and it speaks your language! 💬
